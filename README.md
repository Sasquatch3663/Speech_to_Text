# Speech_to_Text
This project is a simple Speech Recognition application built in Python using the speech_recognition and pyttsx3 libraries. It listens to user input from a microphone, converts speech into text using Google’s Speech Recognition API, and saves the transcribed text into a file (output.txt).


🚀 Features
🎙️ Real-time Speech Recognition – Captures voice input via microphone.
📝 Speech-to-Text Conversion – Converts spoken words into text using Google Speech API.
💾 File Logging – Appends each recognized phrase to output.txt.
🔄 Continuous Listening – Keeps listening in a loop until the program is stopped manually.
🛠️ Error Handling – Handles cases where speech is unclear or recognition fails.

🔮 Future Improvements
Add voice output feedback with pyttsx3.
GUI for easier usage.
Support for multiple languages.
Option to save text in different formats (CSV, JSON, etc.).
