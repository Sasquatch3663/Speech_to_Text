# Speech_to_Text
This project is a simple Speech Recognition application built in Python using the speech_recognition and pyttsx3 libraries. It listens to user input from a microphone, converts speech into text using Googleâ€™s Speech Recognition API, and saves the transcribed text into a file (output.txt).
